# Climate Trend Analysis with ERA5 dataset

This repository contains climate trend analysis scripts produced for the Capstone project of GEOG633, MGIS course, Fall 2024 session, University of Calgary. The goal of this project is to provide a centralized location for all the analysis-ready scripts, both in Python and Google Earth Engine (GEE), to maximize their shareability.

## Introduction

Climate trend analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the long-term changes in weather patterns and their potential impacts on the environment. This project aims to explore various climate trends using Python and GEE, leveraging the ERA5 reanalysis dataset.

This script produces detailed trend maps of temperature changes in North America, aiming to present the potential influence of Arctic Amplification on the mid-latitude jet stream, which may be affecting the winter-time warmth of Chinook winds in southeastern Alberta, as originally presented by Brian Brettschneider, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Dr. John Yackel, University of Calgary. 

## ERA5 Reanalysis Dataset

The ERA5 reanalysis dataset, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), provides comprehensive and high-resolution climate data.
